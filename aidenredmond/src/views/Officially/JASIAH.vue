        <p class="text-left text-lg mb-12 text-opacity-75 sm:text-sm sm:mt-12">JASIAH is a project that streamlines inventory tracking and management using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. By automating tasks and reducing manual effort by over 60%, it minimizes human error and provides real-time insights into inventory levels and discrepancies.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2"><span class="underline">Why</span> is JASIAH?</h2>
        <p class="text-md mb-12 sm:text-sm">Ultimately, JASIAH was born out of pain. Painstakingly counting, scanning, copying and pasting formulas, counts, and items for hours on end.
            JASIAH transformed a long, tedious, complex process (that was prone to human error) into a simple set of steps anyone with basic computer skills can do.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 sm:text-xl">Why is JASIAH important to Aiden Redmond?</h2>
        <p class="text-md mb-12 sm:text-sm">JASIAH was the first time I had written code that would be merged into a constantly evolving system that would be used by real users.
            It would have to be pitched, taught, and implemented into a team of people at a real company.
            This experience taught me to write good code all the time, and to make it dynamic, easily readable, and fast (more than the classroom ever could). </p>
