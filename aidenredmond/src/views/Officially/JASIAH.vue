        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">What is J.A.S.I.A.H?</h2>
        <p class="mb-24">JASIAH is a project designed to streamline and enhance inventory tracking and
            management using Google Sheets & Google Apps Script. <br> By leveraging Google Apps
            Script, a built-in code editor, JASIAH can directly access and manipulate data within
            Google Sheets, improving our inventory process greatly.
            By automating numerous tasks, JASIAH reduces manual eï¬€ort by over 60%, significantly
            minimizes human error, and also provides real-time insights into inventory levels and
            discrepancies</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl"><span class="underline">Why</span> is J.A.S.I.A.H?</h2>
        <p class="mb-24">Ultimately, JASIAH was born out of pain. Painstakingly counting, scanning, copying and pasting formulas, counts, and items for hours on end. <br> 
            JASIAH transformed a long, tedious, complex process (that was prone to human error) into a simple set of steps anyone with basic computer skills can do.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Why is J.A.S.I.A.H important to Aiden Redmond?</h2>
        <p class="mb-24">JASIAH was the first time I had written code that would be merged into a constantly evolving system that would be used by real users.<br>
            It would have to be pitched, taught, and implemented into a team of people at a real company. <br>
            This experience taught me to write good code all the time, and to make it dynamic, easily readable, and fast (more than the classroom ever could).</p>
