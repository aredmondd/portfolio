        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl text-[#3b92e5]">What is Reservoir?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-24">Reservoir is a web app that helps you organize and track your media, connect with friends, share recommendations, and receive personalized AI suggestions.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl text-[#3b92e5]"><span class="underline">Why</span> is Reservoir?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-24">Reservoir exists to fill a gap in the media tracking landscape. While apps like MyAnimeList, IMDb, and Letterboxd serve their purposes, we saw an opportunity to create a more comprehensive, personalized, and user-friendly experience.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl text-[#3b92e5]">Why is Reservoir important to Aiden Redmond?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-24">Reservoir is the most complex, rewarding, and long-term project I've ever worked on. It involved weekly sprints, presenting progress to project managers, and dedicating 15-20 hours per week. As the team leader, I not only guided the project but also managed the responsibilities of others, which significantly enhanced my leadership and project management skills.</p>
